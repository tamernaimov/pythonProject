Exercise 1 (SRP and OCP):
Create a class Payment that handles a basic payment process and a PaymentPrinter that prints payment receipts.
 Then, extend the payment class to handle different types of payments (like credit card and cash).



Exercise 2 (LSP and ISP):
Create a Worker class with work and eat methods. Make Human and Robot classes implement the worker class,
 but robots should only implement the work method, while humans implement both.

Exercise 3 (DIP):
Create a UserRepository that fetches user data. Use an abstraction layer (interface or abstract class)
to decouple UserService from the concrete implementation of UserRepository.
