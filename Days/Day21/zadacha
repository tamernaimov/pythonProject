Objective: Design a simple online shopping system using OOP principles and SOLID design principles.

Requirements:
Products:

Create a Product class with attributes such as name, price, and stock.
Implement a method to display product details.

Shopping Cart:

Create a ShoppingCart class that allows users to add, remove, and view products.
The cart should keep track of the total price and handle the quantities of products.
Payment Processing:

Define an abstract class Payment with a method process_payment(amount).
Create two subclasses: CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment that implement the process_payment method.

Order:

Create an Order class that aggregates the ShoppingCart and handles payment processing.
The Order class should use a Payment object to process payments.
