Requirements:
There are two types of employees:

Full-Time Employees: Paid a fixed salary per month.
Hourly Employees: Paid based on the number of hours they work and their hourly rate.
The system should calculate the salary for each employee.

In the future, there might be additional employee types (e.g., Commission-Based Employees or Contract Workers) with different payroll structures. So the system should be open to extension but closed to modification.

Each employee should be able to print their salary information.
